        Initializes a QuantumExperiment.

        Args:
            dev (Device): Device object used for the experiment. Defaults to None.
            qubits (list): list of qubits used for the experiment (e.g. a subset of
                qubits on the device). Defaults to None. (see circuitBuilder for more
                details).
            operation_dict (dict): dictionary with operations. Defaults to None.
                (see circuitBuilder for more details).
            meas_objs (list): list of measure object (e.g., qubits) to be read
                out (i.e. for which the detector functions will be
                prepared). Defaults to self.qubits (attribute set by
                CircuitBuilder). Required for run_measurement() when qubits
                is None.
            classified (bool): whether
            MC (MeasurementControl): MeasurementControl object. Required for
                run_measurement() if qubits is None and device is None.
            label (str): Measurement label
            exp_metadata (dict): experimental metadata saved in hdf5 file
            upload (bool): whether or not to upload the sequences to the AWGs
            measure (bool): whether or not to measure
            analyze (bool): whether or not to analyze
            temporary_values (list): list of temporary values with the form:
                [(Qcode_param_1, value_1), (Qcode_param_2, value_2), ...]
            drive (str): qubit configuration.
            sequences (list): list of sequences for the experiment. Note that
                even in the case of a single sequence, a list is required.
                Required if sequence_function is None.
            sequence_function (callable): functions returning the sequences,
                see self._prepare_sequences() for more details. Required for
                run_measurement if sequences is None
            sequence_kwargs (dict): keyword arguments passed to the sequence_function.
                see self._prepare_sequences()
            df_kwargs (dict): detector function keyword arguments.
            timer_kwargs (dict): keyword arguments for timer. See pycqed.utilities.timer.
                Timer.
            df_name (str): detector function name.
            mc_points (tuple): tuple of 2 lists with first and second dimension
                measurement control points (previously also called sweep_points,
                but name has changed to avoid confusion with SweepPoints):
                [first_dim_mc_points, second_dim_mc_points]. MC points
                correspond to measurement_control sweep points i.e. sweep points
                directly related to the instruments, e.g. segment readout index.
                Not required when using sweep_functions SegmentSoftSweep and
                SegmentHardSweep as these may be inferred from the sequences objects.
                In case other sweep functions are used (e.g. for sweeping instrument
                parameters), then the sweep points must be specified. Note that the list
                must always have two entries. E.g. for a 1D sweep of LO frequencies,
                mc_points should be of the form: (freqs, [])
            sweep_functions (tuple): tuple of sweepfunctions. Similarly to mc_points,
                sweep_functions has 2 entries, one for each dimension. Defaults to
                SegmentHardSweep for the first sweep dimensions and SegmentSoftSweep
                for the second dimension.
            compression_seg_lim (int): maximal number of segments that can be in a
                single sequence. If not None and the QuantumExperiment is a 2D sweep
                with more than 1 sequence, and the sweep_functions are
                (SegmentHardSweep, SegmentSoftsweep), then the quantumExperiment
                will try to compress the sequences, see Sequence.compress_2D_sweep.
            force_2D_sweep (bool): whether or not to force a two-dimensional sweep.
                In that case, even if there is only one sequence, a second
                sweep_function dimension is added. The idea is to use this more
                and more to generalize data format passed to the analysis.
            callback (func): optional function to call after run_analysis() in
                autorun(). All arguments passed to autorun will be passed down to
                the callback.
            callback_condition (func): function returning a bool to decide whether or
                not the callback function should be executed. Defaults to always True.
