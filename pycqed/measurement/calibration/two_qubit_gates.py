class MultiTaskingExperiment(QuantumExperiment):
    """
    This class adds the concept of tasks to the QuantumExperiment class and
    allows to run multiple tasks in parallel. There are no checks whether a
    parallel execution of tasks makes sense on the used hardware
    (connectivity, crosstalk etc.), i.e., it is up to the experimentalist
    to ensure this by passing a reasonable task_list.

    The concept is that each experiment inherited from this class should
    define a method that creates a block based on the parameters specified
    in a task. The method parallel_sweep can then be used to assemble these
    blocks in parallel.
